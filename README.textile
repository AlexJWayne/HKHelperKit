h1. HKHelperKit

HKHelperKit fixes some annoyances when developing Objective-C applications.  Mostly it just adds some methods to SDK classes to make them easier and less verbose to use.

h2. Usage

# Clone this repository into a HKHelperKit subfolder within your project.
# Drag the HKHelperKit folder into XCode.
# Now simply use <tt>#include "HKHelperKit.h"</tt> anywhere that you want to use HKHelperKit methods.

h2. Features

HKHelperKit enhances the following classes in the following ways:

h3. NSString

* Added simple search methods that let you ask if a string is contained, starts with or ends with another string.
* Added <tt>isPresent</tt> method that is shorthand for: <tt>string && ![string isEqualToString:@""]</tt>.
* Added <tt>compareCaseInsensitive:</tt> method.
* Added class methods for conversion to and from NSData objects.
* Added a URL escape method <tt>stringByEscapingURL</tt>.

h3. UIBarButtonItem

* Added class level initializers for creating any kind of bar items.  Because this: <tt>[UIBarButtonItem flexibleSpace]</tt> is far more awesome than: <tt>[[[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemFlexibleSpace target:nil action:nil] autorelease]</tt>.

h3. UIImage

* Added NSCoding support top UIImage
* Added some simple methods for resizing images.
